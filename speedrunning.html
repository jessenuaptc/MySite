        <p id="col1">Speedrunning is the hobby I am currently most invested in. Speedrunning is the process of completing a game of your choice as fast as possible. Most games have some sort of speedrunning community associated with them. The main game that I run is The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask for the Nintendo 64. I have made many friends through this hobby and it has led me to many great experiences.</p>
        <p id="col2">Some of my favorite games include: The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, Killing Floor 2, The Escapists, Super Mario Odyssey, and Perfect Dark.</p>
